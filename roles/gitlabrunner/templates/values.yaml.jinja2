## For RBAC support:
rbac:
  create: true

  ## Define list of rules to be added to the rbac role permissions.
  ## Each rule supports the keys:
  ## - apiGroups: default "" (indicates the core API group) if missing or empty.
  ## - resources: default "*" if missing or empty.
  ## - verbs: default "*" if missing or empty.
  ##
  ## Read more about the recommended rules on the following link
  ##
  ## ref: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes.html#configure-runner-api-permissions
  ##
  rules: []
  # - resources: ["configmaps", "events", "pods", "pods/attach", "pods/exec", "secrets", "services"]
  #   verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "patch", "update", "delete"]
  # - apiGroups: [""]
  #   resources: ["pods/exec"]
  #   verbs: ["create", "patch", "delete"]
  # - apiGroups: [""]
  #   resources: ["pods/log"]
  #   verbs: ["get"]

  ## Run the gitlab-bastion container with the ability to deploy/manage containers of jobs
  ## cluster-wide or only within namespace
  clusterWideAccess: false

  ## Use the following Kubernetes Service Account name if RBAC is disabled in this Helm chart (see rbac.create)
  ##
  # serviceAccountName: default

## Secrets to be additionally mounted to the containers.
## All secrets are mounted through init-runner-secrets volume
## and placed as readonly at /init-secrets in the init container
## and finally copied to an in-memory volume runner-secrets that is
## mounted at /secrets.
